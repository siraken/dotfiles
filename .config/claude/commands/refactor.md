# Refactoring Suggestions for Project

Review the structure and content of this project and provide specific refactoring suggestions. Pay attention to the following points when making your proposals:

1. **Code Readability**: Check whether the code is readable and easy to understand. Verify if variable names, function names, and class names are appropriate, and if comments are adequately provided.
2. **Code Reusability**: Consider whether there is duplicated code and if common processes can be consolidated into functions or classes.
3. **Performance**: Check for areas where code execution speed or memory usage can be improved.
4. **Test Coverage**: Verify whether unit tests and integration tests are sufficiently covered, and if any necessary tests are missing.
