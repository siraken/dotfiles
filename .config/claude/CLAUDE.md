## Basic rules

- Unless otherwise specified, always respond in 日本語.
- `siraken` is my username.
- When using current date/time, always reference accurate date/time using `date` command or similar methods.
- If you don't know something or if something is unclear, don't force yourself to proceed with the task and communicate that to me.
- When working with projects, determine which package manager to use by checking lock files (such as package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml, etc.) and other project configuration files first.
- When suggesting commit messages, check recent commit messages for prefixes that might be automatically added by Git hooks. Only add prefixes if no automatic prefix configuration is detected to avoid duplication.
